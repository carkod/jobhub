An example of conflict would be, development maintanance tasks are quite normal and very necessary to keep bugs out of the software, apart from the fact that technologies improve constantly, and better ways to do things come up progressively. However, these tasks are not added value tasks for a business, and businesses are encouraged to remove them from the process, because they add cost to the final product.
